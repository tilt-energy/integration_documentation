# API Implementation Phase

The API implementation phase is where you develop your integration based on Tilt's API specifications.

## What to Do

1. Set up authentication and authorization
2. Implement required endpoints
3. Document your specific data and error cases

Our API specification does not list explicitely any error_key, any field_name, any device_type,
because it's your data context. Please document all of these.

## Best Practices

- Follow the API specifications as closely as possible. This will streamline the next steps
- Implement proper error handling, logging, and reporting (in API responses). We'll get a common understanding of the defects. Prefer failing independently at device level rather than global failures for batched endpoints (POST write_actions...)
- Consider performance and scalability. The API will be used to monitor and trigger actions on a great number of devices, therefore each endpoint is specified for batched queries. We may also trigger parrallel calls for several batches of an optimal size according to your own guidance.

## Next Steps

Once your implementation is ready, proceed to the [Validation](validation.md) phase to ensure it meets our requirements.
