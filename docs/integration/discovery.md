# Discovery Phase

The discovery phase is your first step in integrating with Tilt's platform. This phase focuses on 
understanding Tilt's platform, share a common vocabulary, discover our API requirements and discuss 
your own specificities.

## Introduction Meeting

Before diving into the technical details, we'll schedule an introduction meeting to:

1. **Identify Key Collaborators**
    - Technical team members responsible for the integration
    - Decision-makers for technical and business aspects

2. **Discuss Integration Goals**
    - Business objectives and use cases
    - Technical requirements and constraints
    - Timeline expectations
    - Success criteria
    - Target SLAs

3. **Align on Communication**
    - Preferred communication channels (shared slack channel, mail...)
    - Meeting frequency and format

To schedule the introduction meeting, please contact our integration team at [integration-support@tilt-energy.com](mailto:integration-support@tilt-energy.com).

## What to Do

1. Review our [Core Concepts](../concepts/terminology.md)

2. Explore our [API Reference](../api/overview.md)

Tilt team is available to answer any of your questions. This API specification is a solid basis for discussions and express our needs for efficient and secure discovery, monitoring, and remote control of the devices under your control, but we are concious it might not be a perfect fit for your successfull integration to our platform. We are open to discussion and adaptation to your system specifics.

## Next Steps

Once you're familiar with Tilt's platform and concepts, and we have discussed any adaptations to your system specifics, you're ready to move on to the [API Implementation](implementation.md) phase.
