# Production Deployment Phase

The production deployment phase marks the transition from integration testing to live operation.

## What to Expect

We will trigger the first full-scale operations manually during working hours, when we are able to monitor closely and react quickly to any issue. 

We might encounter issues due to the scale of the operation or unforeseen edge cases related to specific devices and conditions. We will address these issues together before moving on.

## Next Steps

After successful deployment, we'll move to [Monitoring & Maintenance](monitoring.md) to ensure ongoing system health.
