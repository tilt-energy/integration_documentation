# Tilt Integration Phase

The Tilt integration phase is where we work together to integrate your implementation with Tilt's platform. Work is mostly on our side this time, but we might ask your support around edge cases or performance issues.

## What to Expect

1. Initial Integration:
    - Tilt will do the integration work
    - Tilt will ask for production credentials and configuration
    - We will schedule together a small scale production launch

2. Testing and Feedback:
    - We will monitor together the initial production deployment
    - Comprehensive testing of the integration
    - Identification of any issues or improvements
    - Collaborative problem-solving

3. Refinement:
    - Addressing any issues found
    - Optimizing performance
    - Ensuring reliability
    - Setting up all relevant monitoring and alerting

## Next Steps

Once the integration is successfully tested on this small scale launch, we'll move on to [Production Deployment](production.md).
