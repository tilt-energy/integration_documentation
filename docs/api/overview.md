# API Overview

This section describes the API specification that your system must implement to integrate with Tilt's platform. Your API must conform to this specification to ensure successful integration.


To begin implementing your API integration:

1. Review the [API Reference](reference.md) to understand the required endpoints
2. Set up [Authentication](authentication.md) following our OAuth2 implementation guide
3. Get into the details of [Action Scheduling](action_scheduling.md) for handling device operations
4. Document how we should control your devices and what errors we should expect, according to our [Documentation Requirements](documentation.md)
