## API Terms

### Request/Response

- **HTTP Method**: The type of operation being performed (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Status Code**: The HTTP response code indicating the result of a request

### Authentication

- **API Key**: A unique identifier used to authenticate API requests
- **Token**: A temporary credential used for authentication
- **Scope**: The permissions granted to an API key or token
- **OAuth2**: An open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication

## Integration Terms

- **Rate Limit**: The maximum number of API requests allowed in a time period
